Half-Decent Blockbuilding Sandbox Game, But It's On Linux Now??? I Don't Think Anyone's Going To Use This Except Me, But Hey, It's There.

Inspired by [wineorc](https://github.com/PlaceholderLabs/WineORC/).
# Requirem
Uhhhhhhh:
- Wine (tested on wine-stable 8.x and wine-devel 9.0rc2, so one of those)
- Linux (may work on macos?)
- A brain
# Usage
`./wine-hill.sh` - normal installation (client, then .desktop/uri)

`./wine-hill.sh -g` - installation of [gamma client](https://github.com/NotWithering/gammainstaller)
# Known bugs
- Vanilla client makes your screen black for a few seconds before joining?? Gamma client supposedly doesn't have this issue
